----- MODAL WINDOW 

A WINDOW WITH AN OVERLAY 
- WHICH GETS OVERLAID OVER THE REST OF THE PAGE 

- TO CLOSE THIS WINDOW WE CAN EITHER THE BUTTOM OR OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW 
- WE CAN ALSO CLOSE BY HITTING THE ESC KEY 

START BY SELECTING THE ELEMENTS THAY WE NEED AND STORE THEM INTO VARIABLES 

---- IMP:: WHENEVER WE USE A QUERYSELECTOR, WHICH ACTUALLY MATCHES WITH MULTIPLE ELEMENTS ONLY THE FIRST ONE WILL GET SELECTED 

what the console will show: <button class ="show-modal">Show modal 1</button> -> ONLY THE FIRST OF THREE BUTTONS WAS SHOWN WITH THE console.log(btnOpenModel);

SO TO SELECT ALL OF THE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS WE USE document.queryselectorAll('.show-button'); 

SO WHAT WILL BE PRINTED IN THE CONSOLE IS A NODELIST(3) [button.show-modal, button.show-modal, button.show-modal] - 

- THE NODELIST LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE AN ARRAY, IT'S NOT EXACTLY LIKE AN ARRAY 

- SO, FOR NOW, IF WE WANT TO DO SOMENTHING WITH ALL OF THESE BUTTONS THEN WE CAN SIMPLY LOOP THROUGH THIS NODELIST
for (let i = 0; i < btnOpenModal.length; i++)
  console.log(btnOpenModal[i].textContent);


--------------- > SO WE SELECTED MULTIPLE ELEMENTS WITH THE SAME CLASS 

  // just like and if-else statement, when there's only one line of code that I want to execute, I actually don't have to use curly braces (a block)
