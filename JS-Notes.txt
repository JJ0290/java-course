Javascript - high level object oritented, multi-paradigm programming language
Programming language - code used to get computers to do something
high level - dont have to worry about complex stuff like memory management
HTML - responsible for content of page (text, buttons)
CSS - styling
JS - add interactive and dynamic effects and web apps
js can run outside of a browser
like nodeJS

Declaring a variable:
let firstName = "John";

JS uses camel case for variables
- you can start a variable with _ or $ as well
- all caps are used for constants
make very descriptive names
myFirstJob is better than job1

every value is an object or a primitive value
- only primitive when its not an object

7 primitive data types
number - always floating point (always have decimals)
string - sequence of characters (always in quotes)
boolean - logical type (true or false)
- not strings
undefined - variable declared without a value or empty
null - means empty value
symbol - value that is unique and cannot be changed
big int - ints too large to be represented by number

dynamic typing - don't need to manually define the data type of the value
- value has the type not the variable
- variables can change between data types without explicitly saying

console.log(typeof true);
- operator that tells the data type returned as a string
