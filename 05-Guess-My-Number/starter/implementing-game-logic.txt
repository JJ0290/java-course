----> IMPLEMENTING THE GAME LOGIC 

We need to implement:

a) when the guess is correct, 
b) when it is equal to the secret number, 
c) what happens when the guess is too low or too high,


A- WE NEED TO DEFINE THE SECRET NUMBER FIRST, OTHERWISE THERE'S NOTHING WHICH WE CAN COMPARE THE GUESS TO 

WHERE DO WE DEFINE THE SECRET NUMBER? 

SHOULD WE DO IT INSIDE THE BUTTON HANDLER OR SHOULD WE DO IT OUTSIDE? 

THE ANSWER IS WE SHOULD DO IT OUTSIDE: 
BECAUSE WE ONLY WANT THAT SECRET NUMBER TO BE DEFINED ONCE, SO ONLY WHEN WE START THE APPLICATION 
 SO IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE HANDLER FUNCTION 

OBS: IF WE DEFINE THE SECRET NUMBER INSIDE OF THIS HANDLER FUNCTION THEN ON EACH CLICK 
WE WOULD GET A NEW SECRET NUMBER - WE JUST NEED ONE NUMBER WHICH WE THEN CAN COMPARE TO EACH OF THE GUESSES ON EACH CLICK 

 if (score > 1) {
      document.querySelector('.message').textContent = 'Too high!';
      score--; // IS THE SAME AS SCORE--
      document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
      console.log(score);
    } else {
      document.querySelector('.message').textContent = 'You lost the game';
      document.querySelector('.score').textContent = 0;
    }
