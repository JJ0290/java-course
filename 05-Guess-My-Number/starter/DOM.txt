// ---> WHATS DOM AND DOM MANIPULATION???

// we're going to make JS interact with a webpage 

// AND THE TECHNICAL TERM FOR THAT IS DOING DOM MANIPULATION 


- WHAT IS DOM????? 

DOM STANDS FOR: Document Object Model and it is basically a structured representation of HTML documents 

THE DOM ALLOWS US TO USE JS TO ACCESS HTML ELEMENTS AND STYLES IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE THEM 

FOR EXAMPLE:  WE WILL BE ABLE TO CHANGE TEXT, HTML ATTRIBUTES AND EVEN CSS STYLES FROM OUR JS 

DOM IS BASICALLY A CONNECTION POINT BETWEEN HTML DOCUMENTS AND JS CODE.

THE DOM IS AUTOMATICALLY CREATED BY THE BROWSER AS SOON AS THE HTML PAGE LOADS 
AND IT'S STORED IN A TREE STRUCTURE GENERATED BY BROWSER ON HTML LOAD 

IN THIS TREE, EACH HTML ELEMENT IS ONE OBJECT

THE DOM TREE LOOKS LIKE A FAMILY TREE AND WE USE TERMS LIKE 
PARENT ELEMENT, CHILD ELEMENT, SIBLING ELEMENT ETC

-- FOR EACH ELEMENT IN THE HTML THERE IS ONE ELEMENT NODE IN THE DOM TREE 
AND WE CAN ACCESS AND INTERACT WITH EACH OF THESE NODES USING JS 

--------- 1. THE DOM ALWAYS STARTS WITH THE DOCUMENT ELEMENT OBJECT RIGHT AT THE VERY TOP.

AND DOCUMENT IS A SPECIAL OBJECT THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO IN JS.
AND THIS OBJECTS SERVES AS AN ENTRY POINT INTO THE DOM
WE USE document.querySelector TO SELECT AN ELEMENT. THAT MEANS THAT THE QUERYSELECTOR METHOD IS AVAILABLE ON THE DOCUMENT OBJECT
THAT'S WHY WE SAY THAT DOCUMENT IS THE ENTRY POINT TO THE DOM

SO DOCUMENT IS THE SPECIAL OBJECT THAT IS THE ENTRY POINT TO THE DOM. EXAMPLE: document.querySelector(put the element as a string) BECAUSE WE NEED TO START SELECTING ELEMENTS

2. THE FIRST CHILD ELEMENT OF THE DOCUMENT IS USUALLY THE HTML (<html>) ELEMENT, BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY THE ROOT ELEMENT IN ALL HTML DOCUMENTS 

3. NEXT, <html> has two child elements, <head> and <body>

ELEMENT <HEAD> CHILDS: ELEMENT <TITLE> -> CHILD OF ELEMENT <TITLE>: ELEMENT <TEXT>

ELEMENT <BODY> CHILDS: ELEMENTS <SECTION>: CHILDS OF ELEMENT <SECTION>: ELEMENT <P> AND ELEMENT <IMG>

CHILDS OF ELEMENT <P>: ELEMENT <A> AND ELEMENT <TEXT>

CHILD OF ELEMENT <A> : TEXT "LINK"

---- DOCUMENT IS THE ENTRY POINT TO THE DOM BECAUSE WE NEED IT TO START SELECTING ELEMENTS 

------ THE RULE IS THAT WHATEVER IS IN THE HTML DOCUMENT ALSO HAS TO BE IN THE DOM 
THE DOM IS A COMPLETE REPRESENTATION OF A HTML DOCUMENT SO WE CAN MANIPULATE IT IN COMPLEX WAYS 

IMP:::::::::::::::::::::: DOM !== JAVASCRIPT 

DOM METHODS AND PROPERTIES FOR DOM MANIPULATION ARE NOT PART OF JS!!!!!! 

JS IS JUST A DIALLECT OF THE ECMA SCRIPT SPECIFICATION AND ALL THIS DOM STUFF IS SIMPLY NOT IN THERE 

IF THE DOM IS NOT A PART OF JS LANGUAGE THE HOW THIS ALL WORK? 

THE DOM AND THE DOM METHODS ARE ACTUALLY PART OF SOMETHING CALLED THE WEB APIs 

-----> THE WEB APIs ARE LIKE LIBRARIES THAT BROWSERS IMPLEMENT AND THAT WE CAN ACCESS FROM OUR JS CODE 

API STANDS FOR::: APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE 

WEB APIs ARE BASICALLY LIBRARIES THAT ARE ALSO WRITTEN IN JS AND THAT ARE AUTOMATICALLY AVAILABLE FOR US TO USE 

-- THERE IS ACTUALLY AN OFFICIAL DOM SPECIFICATION THAT BROWSERS IMPLEMENT 
WHICH IS THE REASON WHY DOM MANIPULATION WORKS THE SAME IN ALL BROWSERS 

BESIDES THE DOM, THERE ARE ACTUALLY A TON MORE WEB APIs SUCH AS TIMERS, THE FETCH API AND MORE
