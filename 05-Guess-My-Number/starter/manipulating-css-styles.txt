- THE DOM ALSO INCLUDES CSS STYLES 

WITH DOM MANIPULATION WE CAN ALSO CHANGE STYLES 


WE NEED TO SELECT THE WHOLE BODY OF THIS PAGE FIRST 
THE BODY IS BASICALLY THE ENTIRE VISIBLE PART OF THE WEBSITE 

IS BASICALLY THE WHOLE <BODY> ELEMENT 

AS ALWAYS, WE NEED TO START BY SELECTING THE ELEMENT THAT WE WANT TO MANIPULATE 

 document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor - NO CLASS, ONLY THE ELEMENT NAME dot style because we want to change the style and the property name 

WHEN WE MANIPULATE THE STYLE WE ALWAYS NEED TO SPECIFY A STRING 
IT HAS TO BE A STRING AND IN THERE WE PUT A UNIT 

// INLINE STYLE IS A STYLE THAT IS APPLIED DIRECTLY IN THE HTML USING THE STYLE ATTRIBUTE 
AND THE SAME IS GOING TO BE TRUE FOR THE BODY 
WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE CSS FILE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS TO USE THE STYLE PROPERTY 
AND THEN ON THERE IS WHERE WE SPECIFY THE CSS PROPERTY 
THE VALUE ALWAYS NEED TO BE A STRING
