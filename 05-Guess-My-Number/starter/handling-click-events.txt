//// HANDLING CLICKING EVENTS 

// THE CODE IS GOING TO REACTS TO SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE DOM 

// AND FOR THAT WE NEED TO USE AN EVENT LISTENER 

AN EVENT IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ON THE PAGE, FOR EXAMPLE A MOUSE CLICK OR A MOUSE MOVING  
OR A KEY PRESS

WITH THE EVENT LISTENER WE CAN WAIT FOR A CERTAIN EVENT TO HAPPEN AND THEN REACT TO IT 

IN ORDER TO LISTEN FOR EVENTS WE FIRST NEED TO SELEC THE ELEMENT WHERE THE EVENT SHOULD HAPPEN 
AND IN THIS CASE WE NEED TO LIST FOR THE EVENT IN THE BOTTON ELEMENT BECAUSE IT IS WHERE THE CLICK WE ARE INTERESTED IN WILL HAPPEN 

// we need to put a function alongisde the method addeventlistener, and it's a special kind of function.
//that's because aas a second argument, it expects this event handler function - in the second argument we need to pass a function to be what the code does qhen we click the buttom
// IT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE A FUNCTION IS JUST A VALUE - THEN WE CAN ALSO PASS IT INTO ANOTHER FUNCTION AS AN ARGUMENT
// just like any other value, like a string or a number
// THE FUNCTION IS THE EVENT HANDLER
// WE DID NOT CALL THE FUCNTION IT WILL BE JS WHO WILL CALL THIS FUNCTION AS SOON AS THE EVENT HAPPENS
document.querySelector('.check').addEventListener('click', function () {
  const guess = Number(document.querySelector('.guess').value);
  console.log(guess, typeof guess);

  // IN CASE THERE IS NO GUESS
  if (!guess) {
    document.querySelector('.message').textContent = 'No number!';
  }

  // THE OUTPUT IS ZERO CAUSE ZERO IS A FALSE VALUE
  // THAT WAS THE FIRST SCENARIO
  // THE FIRST SCENARIO IS ALWAYS TO ASSUME THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY NO INPUT
});

// THE INPUT VALUE FROM THE USER WILL BE A STRING ALWAYS
// THIS FUNCTION WILL NOT BE CALLED IMMEDIATELY ONCE THE SCRIPT IS EXECUTED
// THIS FUNCTION WILL ONLY BE CALLED AS SOON AS THE EVENT HAPPENS
// IN ORDER TO COMPARE THE NUMBERS, WE NEED TO CONVERT THE RESDULT OF GUESS TO A NUMBER

// USUALLY IN AN APPLICATION LIKE THIS WHICH HAS AN INPUT VALUE FROM THE USER,
// THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO CHECK IF THERE ACTUALLY IS A VALUE
// AND IF THERE IS NO VALUE THEN WE CAN PRINT SOMETHING TO THE CONSOLE AS A RESPONSE
