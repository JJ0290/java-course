// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Coding Challenge #5
// Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new
// gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
// Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so
// one average score per team).
// A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.
// Otherwise, no team wins!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
// 2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
// 3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
// as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
// to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
// Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
// 4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
// Data 2
// 5. Ignore draws this time
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
// ยง Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
// Hints:
// ยง To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
// ยง To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B.
// Apply this to the team's average scores

// Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
const calcAverage = (scoreOne, scoreTwo, scoreThree) => (scoreOne + scoreTwo + scoreThree) / 3;

// Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
let dolphinsAvgScr = calcAverage(44, 23, 71);
let koalasAvgScr = calcAverage(65, 54, 49);
// console.log(dolphinsAvgScr, koalasAvgScr);

// Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
// as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
// to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
// Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
const checkWinner = function (dolphinsAvgScr, koalasAvgScr) {

    if (dolphinsAvgScr >= 2 * koalasAvgScr) {

        return console.log(`Dolphins win with an average score of ${dolphinsAvgScr}`);

    } else if (koalasAvgScr >= 2 * dolphinsAvgScr) {

        return console.log(`Koalas win with an average score of ${koalasAvgScr}`);

    } else {

        return "No Winners";
    }
}

console.log(checkWinner(dolphinsAvgScr, koalasAvgScr));

dolphinsAvgScr = calcAverage(85, 54, 41);
koalasAvgScr = calcAverage(23, 34, 27);
console.log(checkWinner(dolphinsAvgScr, koalasAvgScr));
// functions can be called with different applicable values over and over
// console.log(checkWinner(565, 100));
