------> HTML ATTRIBUTES, CLASSES AND IDS

IN HTML SOME ELEMENTS CAN HAVE ATTRIBUTES, ANS THESE ATTRIBUTES BASICALLY DESCRIBE ELEMENTS

WE CAN PUT ELEMENTS INSIDE ANOTHER

AN EXAMPLE OF AN ATTRIBUTE IS : 


anchor element: <a> href= " URL " Jonas on Udemy  </a> DESCRIBE ANCHOR ELEMENT TO PUT A LINK WITH HREF:
HREF: HYPERTEXT REFERENCE.
- ANCHOR IS AN INLINE ELEMENT

- h2 IS AN BLOCK ELEMENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN LINE 

<a href ="URL" > </a>

---->> ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT NEEDS AN ATTRIBUTE IS THE IMAGE ELEMENT: 

<img src = "" /> 

OBS: THE IMAGE ELEMENT DOES NOT HAVE A CLOSING TAG!!!!!

-- DIFFERENT ELEMENTS HAVE DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES

THE href ATTRIBUTE IS NOT GOING TO WORK WITH THE IMG ELEMENT AND THE src ATTRIBUTE
IS NOT GOING TO WORK WITH THE ANCHOR ATTRIBUTE

---- THERE ARE TWO ATTRIBUTES THAT WE CAN USE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS- AND WHICH WE CAN USE TO
IDENTIFY THEM -- AND THESE ARE CLASSES AND IDS!!!!!!!!

WE USE CLASSES AND IDS TO ESSENTIALLY NAME ELEMENTS SO WE CAN THEN SELECT THEM IN CSS IN ORDER TO STYLE THEM

-- AND ACTUALLY WE ALSO USE IDS AND CLASSES TO SELECT ELEMENTS FROM JS 
WHEN WE DO DOM MANIPULATION

-- SO CLASSES AND IDS ARE CRUCIAL TO IDENTIFYING ELEMENTS
AND SPECIALLY CLASSES  

IMP:::: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASSES AND IDS IS THAT IDS HAVE TO BE UNIQUE!!!!

SO EACH ID CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE ON THE PAGE WHILE CLASSES CAN BE USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 

--> IT'S A BETTER PRACTICE TO USE CLASSES TO STYLE ELEMENTS OR SELECT THEM FROM JS 


--------> CREATING A BOX (<DIV></DIV>)
<form id="your-name">
    <h2>Your name here</h2> 
    <p> please fill this form </p> 
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" (OBS: TYPE ATTRIBUTE TO SPECIFY THE TYPE OF DATA THAT SHOULD BE INPUTTED INTO THIS ELEMENT) - USING AN ATTRIBUTE TO DESCRIBE THIS ELEMENT>
    (OBS: THE INPUT ELEMENT DOES NOT HAVE A CLOSING TAG)
    <button>OK!</button>
</form>

THE FOR ELEMENT BETTER DESCRIBES THE CONTENT THAT IS INSIDE OF THE BOX
THAN JST THE GENERIC BOX THAT IS THE DIV  

-----> USING THE APPROPRIATE ELEMENT, ACCORDING TO THE CONTENT THAT'S IN IT IS THE IDEA OF SEMANTIC HTML. 
WHEN INPUT AND button WE USE FORM!!!
