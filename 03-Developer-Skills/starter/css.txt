-----> BASIC STYLING WITH CSS 



WE USE CSS TO STYLE ELEMENTS AND TO CREATE A LAYOUT FOR THE OVERRALL PAGE 
WE CAN STYLE IN THE HTML FILE USING THE STYLE ELEMENT. 

AND THE STYLE ELEMENT IS NOT FOR VISIBLE CONTENT 
SO IT SHOULD GO RIGHT HERE INTO THE HEAD 

----> THE HEAD IS BASICALLY LIKE FOR SETTINGS OF THE PAGE 
AND THE STYLE COUNTS AS A SETTING 

<head>

<style> 
to style elements we need to first select them and there are different types of selectors in CSS. 
THE MOST BASIC ONE IS THE ELEMENT SELECTOR.
With the element selector we CAN SIMPLY SELECT ALL ELEMENTS OF A CERTAIN TYPE, FOR EXAMPLE: THE BODY  

body { here we write our CSS declarations.
   Each CSS declaration has a property name, and then a value  
   background-color: green; 

 }

</style
 
</head> 

WE WRITE THE CSS CODE IN A SEPARATE FILE 
SO WE LINK IT ( THE CSS FILE TO THE HTML FILE) USING THE LINK ELEMENT 

ANCHOR ELEMENT CREATE A CLICKABLE LINK BUT THE LINK ELEMENT DOES NOT!!!!

<link href="style.css" rel= "stylesheet"/> 

THE LINK ELEMENT DOES NOT HAVE A CLOSING TAG 

body { here we write our CSS declarations.
   Each CSS declaration has a property name, and then a value  
   background-color: green;
   font-family: Arial;

 }

 OBS: THE FONT FAMILY PROPERTY IS A PROPERTY THAT GETS INHERITED
 SO ALL THE CHILD ELEMENTS OF THE BODY ELEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALY GET 
 THIS FONT FAMILY ASSIGNED TO THEM!!!!  

MOST PROPERTIES DO NOT INHERIT!!!
BUT GENERALLY, ALL THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE RELATED TO FONTS 
WILL INHERIT 

body { here we write our CSS declarations.
   Each CSS declaration has a property name, and then a value  
   background-color: green;
   font-family: Arial;
   font-size: 20px;
 }

OBS: The elements h1 and h2 don't change when you set the font size
And that's because they have predefined font size that automaticaly are applied from the browser
if we do not specify them on our own. 

- BUT OF COURSE WE CAN OVERWRITE THEM WITH OUR OWN SELECTORS 

- ANOTHER ELEMENT SELECTOR BUT IN THIS CASE WITH THE H1 

h1{
  font-size: 40p;
}

NOW LET'S USE THE CLASS NAMES AND THE IDS TO NOW SELECT ELEMENTS BASED ON THESE CLASSES 

----WE SELECT A CLASS BY USING A DOT: 

.first{
  color: red;
}

--- HOW TO SELECT BASED ON ID: 

OBS: WE CAN SET MULTIPLE VALUES FOR THE BORDER PROPERTY 
#your-name{
  background-color: yellow; 
  border: 5px solid #444 (RGB COLORS)
}
