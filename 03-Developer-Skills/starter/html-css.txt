----> BASIC HTML STRUCTURE AND ELEMENTS 


INDEX.HTML IS ALWAYS THE NAME OF THE MAIN FILE IN ANY PROJECT

HTML ---> STANDS FOR HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE AND WE USE TO DESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF WEBPAGES BASICALLY
          AN HTML DOCUMENT IS MADE OUT OF ELEMENTS AND WE WRITE ELEMENTS USING AN OPENING  AND A CLOSING TAG <> 
          THE MAIN ELEMENT IN ALL HTML DOCUMENTS IS ALWAYS THE HTML ELEMENT <html></html>
          INSIDE THE HTML ELEMENT WE HAVE THE HEAD TAG AND BODY TAG:
          <head> </head> <body> </body>

        1- HEAD: <head> </head> Everything we put inside of the head is basically like the 
                 settings of the page. It's like describing the page. 
                 For example with the title: 
                 <head>
                 <title> Learning HTML & CSS </title>
                 </head>


        2- BODY ------> Whatever we put inside body is what's actually gonna be visible on the page
             We use the Heading(h1) - level 1 heading inside the body: 
             <body>
             <h1> JavaScript is fun, but so is HTML & CSS </h1> 
             <p>
             </p>
             </body>


--- DIFFERENT TYPES OF ELEMENTS HAVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES. FOR EXAMPLE H1 IS TO DESCRIBE A HEADING. 
    BUT WE HAVE OTHER ONES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE THE P ELEMENT TO DESCRIBE A PARAGRAPH
