-----> DEBUGING PROCESS

-IDENTIFY IT: 

1- DURING DEVELOPMENT 
2- TESTING SOFTWARE 
3- USER REPORTS DURING PRODUCTION
4- CONTEXT: BROWSERS, USERS, ETC 

-WHEN WE FIND IT: 

ISOLATING WHERE EXACTLY THE BUG IS HAPPENING IN THE CODE

1- DEVELOPER CONSOLE (SIMPLE CODE);
2- DEBUGGER (COMPLEX CODE) --> WHEN WE DON'T HAVE IDEA WHERE THE BUG MIGHT BE 


-FIX THE BUG:

-PREVENT: 

1-SEARCH FOR THE SAME BUG IN SIMILAR CODE;

2- WRITE TESTS USING TESTING SOFTWARE 

OBS::: THE PROMPT ALWAYS RETURN A STRING, SO IF WE INPUT A NUMBER, IT WILL BE A STRING
THE + OPERATOR WHEN IT SEES A STRING, IT WILL CONVERT BOTH OPERANDS TO A STRING AND THEN CONCATENATE THE STRINGS

CONSOLE.TABLE -> SHOWS THE OBJECTS IN A FORMATED TABLE 
CONSOLE.WARN()/ CONSOLE.ERROR() -> SHOWS WARN/ERROR IN THE CONSOLE
