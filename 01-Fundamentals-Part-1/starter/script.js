// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
// and height in meter).

// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables

let markMass = 78
let markHeight = 1.69

let johnMass = 92
let johnHeight = 1.95

// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
// versions)

let markBmi = markMass / markHeight ** 2
let johnBmi = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2

console.log(`The BMI of Mark is ${markBmi} and the BMI of John is ${johnBmi}`)

// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

let markHigherBMI = markBmi > johnBmi
console.log(markHigherBMI)

// Test data:
// ยง Data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
// m tall.
